# Blueprint Library
Kelda blueprints have been written for many popular applications. Here are some
that we recommend trying out:

* [HAProxy](https://github.com/kelda/haproxy)
* [MEAN stack](https://github.com/kelda/mean) (MongoDB, Express, Angular, and Node.js)
* [Slackin](https://github.com/kelda/slackin)
* [Spark](https://github.com/kelda/spark)

If you would like your blueprint to be on this list, feel free to
[submit a pull request](https://github.com/kelda/kelda/blob/master/docs/_BlueprintLibrary.md)!
