## Deploying your MEAN stack app with Quilt
Let's deploy the very simple MEAN stack app located in
[github.com/LuiseV/awesome-restaurant-app](https://github.com/LuiseV/awesome-restaurant-app.git).

The MEAN stack (MongoDB, Express, AngularJS, and node.js) is a popular fullstack
JavaScript framework used for web development. Deploying a flexible, multi-node
MEAN stack app can be both time consuming and costly, but Quilt simplifies this
process.

The [`specs/mean`](./specs/mean) directory in the Quilt repository already
contains the code for deploying the multi-node MEAN stack that we will use for
our `awesome-restaurant-app`. All we have to do is tweak a few lines of code in
the [`quilt/specs/mean`](./specs/mean) directory, to ensure that _our_
application is deployed. Specifically we will make changes to the following
files:

* [`specs/mean/Dockerfile`](./specs/mean/Dockerfile) (1 line)
* [`specs/mean/Makefile`](./specs/mean/Makefile) (1 line)
* [`specs/mean/example.js`](./specs/mean/example.js) (2 lines)

### How to

##### Our app
First, we make sure that our MongoDB connection URI is set to the `MONGO_URI`
environment variable. E.g.:

```javascript
var mongoose = require('mongoose');
mongoose.connect(process.env.MONGO_URI);
```

##### specs/mean/Dockerfile
In [`specs/mean/Dockerfile`](./specs/mean/Dockerfile), we change the `git clone`
command to clone the Github repository that contains our app.

```
RUN git clone https://github.com/LuiseV/awesome-restaurant-app.git .
```

##### specs/mean/Makefile
Change the `REPO` constant in [`specs/mean/Makefile`](./specs/mean/Makefile) so
it points to our container registry repository (e.g. on
[Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/)).

```
REPO = luise/awesome-restaurant-app
```

This way we will push and pull our application image to/from our personal
repository in the next step.

##### Build and Push Image
In the [`specs/mean`](./specs/mean) directory, run `make push-image`. This will
build an image from the Dockerfile we just modified, and push the resulting
image to our image registry repository.

```
$ make push-image
The push refers to a repository [docker.io/luise/awesome-restaurant-app]
...
```

The above step requires that Docker is installed and running, and that we're
authenticated. Check out
[Docker's website](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/) for more.

##### specs/mean/example.js
The `Node` constructor called in
[`specs/mean/example.js`](./specs/mean/example.js) takes a string `image` which
specifies the location of a container image. The Node.js application containers
will be created from this image, so let's have it point to the image we just
created:

```javascript
var app = new Node({
  ...
  image: "luise/awesome-restaurant-app",
  ...
});
```

Finally, before we deploy our MEAN stack, let's set the `githubKeys` property to
be our Github username. This way we can ssh into the VMs in our deployment using
any ssh key associated with our Github profile.

```javascript
var baseMachine = new Machine({
    ...
    sshKeys: githubKeys("ejj"),
});
```

If you want to change the characteristics of the VMs, go ahead and modify the
relevant properties of the `baseMachine` object.

##### Deploy
Now we're ready to deploy our MEAN stack application! In one shell, run `quilt
daemon`, and in another, run `quilt run specs/mean/example.js` - both from the
`quilt` directory. You should see something like this:

```
$ quilt daemon
INFO [Nov  1 20:18:28.133] db.Cluster:
    Cluster-1{Namespace=luise}
INFO [Nov  1 20:18:28.133] db.Machine:
    Machine-2{Master, Amazon us-west-1 c4.large, Disk=32GB}
    Machine-3{Worker, Amazon us-west-1 c4.large, Disk=32GB}
    ...
```

and 

```
$ quilt run specs/mean/example.js
Successfully started run.
```

The VMs are fully booted when it says `Connected` in the daemon log. You can get
additional useful information about the running VMs and containers with the
commands `quilt machines` and `quilt containers`. It will take a few minutes
from when the VMs are `Connected`, until the proxies and application are ready
to process requests.

##### Access Web App
We can now access our web app by using the public IP address of any worker
machine. We can get the public IP of a worker machine from the quilt daemon log
or the output of `quilt machines`. The following shows that there is a Worker VM
at the public IP address 52.53.236.192:

```
Machine-2{Master, Amazon us-west-1 c4.large, sir-zvrrcvfk, PublicIP=54.67.106.64, PrivateIP=172.31.10.253, Disk=32GB}
Machine-7{Worker, Amazon us-west-1 c4.large, sir-cpf8c81k, PublicIP=52.53.236.192, PrivateIP=172.31.15.56, Disk=32GB}
```

Now, simply go to `http://WORKER_PUBLIC_IP:80` in your browser. As you see, our
app is up!

##### Shut Down VMs
To shut down our application and VMs, run `quilt stop`, and wait for the message
`Successfully halted machines.` in the quilt daemon output.

### Notes
Floating IPs are in progress and will be released soon.
