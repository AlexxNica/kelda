# Kelda

Kelda enables anyone to deploy complex applications to the cloud
by encoding expertise about how to run those applications in JavaScript
_blueprints_.

This site describes how to use Kelda. It describes how to
install Kelda to run a blueprint, and also how to write your own blueprint
for a new application.
